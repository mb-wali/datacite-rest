Datacite Rest API for minting DOI

## Developer guide

datacite-rest uses [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) as development toolkit.

Install the library:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the demo application:

```bash
npm start
```

The library uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as test runner. To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

The library uses `rollup` to build a final version inside the `/dist` folder and it will build CommonJS and ES Modules versions:

```bash
npm run build
```
